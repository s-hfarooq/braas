# Auto-Generated Video Content Platform
## System Overview

This platform delivers AI-generated short-form video content to users through a web interface. The system utilizes a local video generation model and employs a microservices architecture for content management and delivery.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Text LLM Service (Brainrot & Co)
- Primary function: Generates video concepts and scripts
- Input: User prompts ("generate me brainrot")
- Output: Text descriptions/scripts for video generation
- Implementation: Text generation model running locally
- Considerations: 
  - Need to ensure appropriate content filtering
  - Response time optimization for real-time generation
  - Content variety to maintain user engagement

### 2. Video Generation Service
- Core component: Docker container running the video generation model
- Functionality:
  - Processes text inputs from LLM
  - Generates video content based on prompts
  - Manages rendering queue
- Technical Requirements:
  - GPU support for efficient video generation
  - Resource monitoring and scaling capabilities
  - Error handling for failed generations

### 3. Database (DB)
- Purpose: Persistent storage for:
  - Generated video metadata
  - User preferences and history
  - Content performance metrics
- Schema Considerations:
  - Video metadata (ID, timestamp, prompt, metrics)
  - User interaction data
  - System performance logs
- Performance Requirements:
  - Fast read operations for video serving
  - Efficient indexing for content retrieval
  - Backup and recovery procedures

### 4. Video Frontend
- User Interface Features:
  - Swipe-based navigation (similar to short-form video platforms)
  - Generate 5 streams of content per swipe
  - Infinite scroll functionality
- Technical Implementation:
  - Progressive loading for smooth user experience
  - Client-side caching for performance
  - Responsive design for multiple devices

## System Flow

1. Content Generation:
   - User triggers content generation through UI
   - Request sent to Text LLM service
   - Text prompt processed by video generation service
   - Generated video stored in DB
   - Content served to user through frontend

2. Content Delivery:
   - User swipes to request new content
   - System pre-generates 5 video streams
   - Frontend fetches videos from DB
   - Smooth playback handling with preloading

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- Docker support for containerization
- Local GPU computing capabilities
- Database management system
- Web server for frontend hosting

### Performance Metrics
- Video generation time: < 30 seconds
- Frontend response time: < 200ms
- Content buffer: Minimum 5 videos ahead
- Storage requirements: Based on video length and quality

### Security Considerations
- Content filtering and moderation
- User data protection
- API endpoint security
- Resource access controls

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices
- Implement robust error handling
- Use asynchronous processing for video generation
- Maintain logs for system monitoring
- Follow responsive design principles

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each service
- Integration testing for service communication
- Load testing for concurrent users
- UI/UX testing for frontend

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of video generation
- Content delivery optimization
- Database partitioning strategy
- Caching implementation

### Monitoring
- System health metrics
- Content generation success rate
- User engagement analytics
- Resource utilization tracking

## Deployment

### Requirements
- Docker engine
- GPU drivers and CUDA support
- Database system
- Web server configuration

### Setup Process
1. Configure local environment
2. Deploy database system
3. Initialize video generation container
4. Set up Text LLM service
5. Deploy frontend application

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor system resources
- Update AI models
- Database optimization
- Performance tuning
- Security updates

### Backup Strategy
- Regular database backups
- Configuration backups
- Video content archiving
- System state snapshots
